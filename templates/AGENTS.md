# Agent Instructions

This project uses **Skillstack** - a skills management system for AI agents.

## Skills System Overview

**Skills** are reusable automation for common tasks located in:
- **Codex CLI**: `~/.codex/skills/`
- **Claude Code**: `~/.claude/skills/`

Each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file containing instructions.

## Quick Start

**At the start of every session**, check for available skills:

```bash
# If skillstack is installed:
~/.skillstack/skillstack list

# Or read directly (both Codex and Claude Code):
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Using a Skill

When you identify a relevant skill for the task:

1. **View the skill's instructions**:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using skillstack CLI
   ~/.skillstack/skillstack use <skill-name>

   # Option 2: Read SKILL.md directly
   cat ~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
   # or
   cat ~/.codex/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
   ```

2. **Read and follow SKILL.md**:
   - The frontmatter `description` field tells you **when** to use the skill
   - The markdown content tells you **how** to use the skill
   - Supporting files (scripts, templates) are referenced within SKILL.md

3. **Execute proactively**:
   - If the SKILL.md description says "ALWAYS" or "immediately" - invoke it without asking
   - Skills are tested and reliable - prefer using skills over manual work
   - Don't wait for the user to explicitly request the skill

## Skill Discovery Workflow

```
User makes request
       ↓
Check if you've listed skills this session
       ↓ No                    ↓ Yes
Run ~/.skillstack/skillstack list      Use cached knowledge
       ↓                          ↓
Identify relevant skill from list
       ↓ Found                ↓ Not found
Read SKILL.md           Do manual work
       ↓
Follow SKILL.md instructions step-by-step
       ↓
Report results to user
```

## Important Principles

1. **Skills are self-contained** - All instructions and dependencies are in SKILL.md
2. **Read, don't assume** - Always read SKILL.md to get current instructions
3. **Be proactive** - Use skills automatically when they match the task
4. **Skills are optional** - If no relevant skill exists, proceed with manual work
5. **Check at session start** - Run `~/.skillstack/skillstack list` at the beginning of each session

## File Structure

```
~/.codex/skills/  or  ~/.claude/skills/
├── ansible-fix/
│   ├── SKILL.md              # Instructions
│   ├── CHANGELOG.md          # Version history
│   └── ansible-lint-fix.py   # Supporting script
└── skill-builder/
    └── SKILL.md
```

## Example Session

```
User: "Create a new nginx ansible role"

You think:
  1. New session - should check for skills
  2. Run: ~/.skillstack/skillstack list
  3. Output shows: "ansible-fix - ALWAYS use after ansible-galaxy init"
  4. Task involves creating ansible role - ansible-fix is relevant
  5. Read: cat ~/.claude/skills/ansible-fix/SKILL.md
  6. SKILL.md says: "Run after ansible-galaxy init"

You execute:
  - ansible-galaxy init roles/nginx
  - [Follow all steps from ansible-fix SKILL.md]
  - Report results to user
```

## Summary

- **AGENTS.md (this file)**: Teaches you about the skills system
- **SKILL.md (each skill)**: Teaches you how to use that specific skill

**Always read SKILL.md to get the actual workflow instructions.**
